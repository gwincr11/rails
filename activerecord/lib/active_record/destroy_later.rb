  # Automatically destroy records after a specified amount of time.

  #
  # +destroy_later+ adds an +after_commit+ callback that schedules an ActiveRecord::DestroyJob. In the example above,
  # we use +completed_previously_changed?+ to check whether the record's +completed+ flag was changed in the preceding
  # save. (+completed_changed?+ wouldn't work because any prior changes to the record have been saved at the time the
  # condition is evaluated.)
  #
  # Optionally pass the name of an instance method in +ensuring:+. If the given method returns false at the
  # scheduled destroy time, the record will not be destroyed.
  #
  #   # Destroy exports 30 days after completing them, ensuring they're still marked as completed at destroy time
  #   class Export < ApplicationRecord
  #     destroy_later after: 30.days, if: -> { status_previously_changed? && completed? }, ensuring: :completed?
